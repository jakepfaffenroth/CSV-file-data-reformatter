There was a period of time where Eden thiought I was a male but it took some time for her to realize that I am not a male in sense of my anatomy but that I am not fememine either. My son went through a similar phase. Eden also has an older classmate who was makle and went by male pronouns and a male name; but he would sometimes wear skirts and dresses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
